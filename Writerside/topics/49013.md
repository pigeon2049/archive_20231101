Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Wednesday a recovery plan for the battered coastal resort of Acapulco will include tax breaks, financial assistance for affected families and bringing forward social welfare payments.

Last week Hurricane Otis slammed into Acapulco, devastating local infrastructure, severing communications and temporarily leaving the city of 900,000 people incommunicado.
