The bank made a single addition for November on its Analyst Focus List, highlighting food service stock Aramark .

JPMorgan removed athleisure retailer and clothing company Lululemon in November, as well as uniform provider Cintas . Lululemon stock has climbed 20% so far in 2023.

Analyst Richard Shane noted that NMI has been an outperformer since the start of the year and has surpassed its coverage targets, with shares adding 31% from the start of 2023. Analyst Eric Joseph said the catalyst underpinning Revolution's inclusion on previous focus lists has already come to fruition and was behind the removal.
