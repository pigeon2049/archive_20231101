Abstract:

Due to the extremely high global demand for this type of domain, the prices of three-letter .com domains are exceedingly high. A foreign domain organization compiled a list of publicly reported sales of three-letter .com domains

Three-letter .com domains have an extremely high market value. These domains are short and easily remembered, and due to their rarity and extensive demand, they hold significant value. The selling prices of many "LLL.com" domains range from six to seven figures. However, most transactions are conducted privately and not publicly reported.

Due to the very high global demand for this type of domain, the prices of three-letter .com domains are exceedingly high. A certain foreign domain organization has compiled a list of publicly reported sales of three-letter .com domains between 2014 and 2023, obtained from NameBio, DNJournal, SEC filings, and other sources, listed in chronological order.
