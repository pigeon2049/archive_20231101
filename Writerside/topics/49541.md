France's weather service put some northern and western regions, including Brittany, under high alert and authorities urged people to stay indoors, saying storm Ciaran was set to hit overnight with heavy rain and winds of up to 170 kph.

"To all those concerned, be careful ... and avoid moving around overnight," Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said.
