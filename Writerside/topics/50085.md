Knight was called "a legend among coaches" by the [Basketball Hall of Fame](https://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/bob-knight/), where he was inducted in 1991.

He played for the Ohio State Buckeyes when the team captured the 1960 NCAA championship, and he coached the Indiana Hoosiers from 1971 to 2000 â€” when the team won three NCAA titles.

Knight also coached on the world stage. In 1984, he was leading the U.S. Men's Olympic Basketball Team when it won the gold medal at the Summer Games in Los Angeles.

Knight was Big Ten coach of the year five times and a four-time national coach of the year.

Knight was born in Massillon, Ohio, on Oct. 25, 1940.

He is one of only three coaches to win "the triple crown" with an NCAA title, an NIT title and an Olympic gold medal, the Hall of Fame said.

Knight's family requested that in lieu of flowers, memorial contributions be made to the Alzheimer's Association or Marian University in Indianapolis
