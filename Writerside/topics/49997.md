Stocks gained Thursday as Treasury yields fell, with investors betting the Federal Reserve could be done raising rates for 2023.

The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) traded 513 points higher, or 1.5%, steadily gaining higher on the session as yields declined. The Dow is up more than 600 points in two days. The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) and [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) climbed 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively. The S&P 500 and Dow are on track for their biggest weekly gain of the year, putting the broad market index on pace for its best day since May.

Dow, 1-day

The rally was broad-based, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors trading in positive territory. Gains were led by real estate and consumer discretionary, two sectors hit hard earlier in the year amid worries about higher rates.

Bond yields declined, with the 10-year Treasury yield dropping by about 12 basis points at 4.674%. That comes after the benchmark yield topped 5% last month.

Data released Thursday morning showed easing inflation and a slowing labor market, adding to investor confidence the Federal Reserve could be done raising rates. [Labor costs unexpectedly dropped](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/02/labor-costs-show-surprise-decline-in-the-third-quarter.html) in the third quarter, the Labor Department said Thursday. And weekly jobless claims on Thursday ticked higher to 217,000.

10-year Treasury yield, 1-day

The Fed on Wednesday kept interest rates unchanged for a second straight time, unleashing a rally in [the Dow](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) of more than 200 points. The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) and [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) each ended up more than 1%.

"There is a little bit of a follow through from yesterday, and then this morning, we got some of the productivity and unit labor cost numbers, and the unit labor cost numbers are actually negative," said Megan Horneman, investment chief at Verdence Capital Advisors. "That is adding to some of the relief that maybe we're getting some of that sticky inflation under control that the Fed has been mentioning."

To be sure, Horneman is concerned investors may be overly optimistic as Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday noted he would not rule out a rate increase at the December meeting.

"I think that there still is volatility we'll see in inflation," Horneman said. "The one thing that concerns us is that inflation is extremely easy to reignite."

[Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) and [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) led a gain in tech shares Thursday as investors cheered the drop on rates. Apple added almost 2% ahead of its earnings report after the bell.

"While we've already missed out on the run this year (>350% vs. XBI -20%) following data in Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) supporting a best-in-class IL-17 profile, we think there's clear room for potential upside via derisking of additional indications and/or M&A," Thompson wrote.

Individual investor bearishness soars to highest since last Christmas, AAII says
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bearishness over the short-term outlook for stocks climbed to 50.3% in the latest weekly survey from the American Association of Individual Investors, the highest since last Christmas (Dec. 22, 2022) , up from 43.2% last week and far above the historical average of 31.0% for a seventh week.

Bullishness over the short-term outlook for stocks dropped to just 24.3% in the weekly poll, the weakest since mid-May, down from 29.3% last week and below the historical average of 37.5% for a third week.

That's all good news for contrarian investors who believe declining bullishness means there's cash on the sidelines that can come into the stock market, at the same time as rising bearishness means most of the selling is out of the way.

Treasury yields keep sliding, pushing stock futures higher Thursday
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Yields on Treasurys kept sliding early Thursday, helping push U.S. stock index futures higher as debate raged over whether "risk on" trades will return.

Two-year Treasury notes yielded 4.954% and 10-year notes had fallen all the way 4.691% after briefly topping 5% two weeks ago. Bids in Treasurys come as the chance of another quarter point Federal Reserve rate increase at its Dec. 13 policy meeting crumbles -- down to a less than 1 in 7 probability (14.6%), according to the CME FedWatch tool that uses interest rate futures prices.

S&P 500 index futures were recently 31 points higher at 4237, up about 0.7%, while Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 161 or 1.1% to 14,906.

As inflation weakens, "yields will probably drop further but settle at a much higher level than before the pandemic," London-based Capital Economics wrote Thursday.

Fed gets some good news in falling labor costs
----------------------------------------------

Weekly jobless claims came in slightly higher than expected, pointing to an economic slowdown the Fed wants. Jobless claims rose to 217,000 for the week, compared to the consensus economist estimate of 214,000, according to Dow Jones.

Treasury yields continued their slide lower as the numbers hit and stock futures extended their gains.

Market sees only a small chance of a December rate hike
-------------------------------------------------------

Markets found enough in this week's Federal Reserve meeting to suggest that there's only a small chance of any additional interest rate hike.

The odds for a December increase fell Thursday morning to 14.6%, according the [CME Group's FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html), which uses fed funds futures pricing to gauge probabilities. A month ago, the chances of a move in December were at 39%.

Futures pricing, which can be volatile and swing quickly, now indicates that the first rate cut could come as soon as May.

Peloton shares drop after wider-than-expected loss

Peloton posted a loss of 44 cents per share, more than the per-share loss of 34 cents expected by analysts surveyed by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Revenue beat expectations, coming in at $595.5 million, more than the $591 million anticipated.

The company is forecasting revenue of between $715 million and $750 million in its holiday quarter, representing an 8% drop at the midpoint compared to the year-ago period. That falls short of the $763.2 million analysts had expected for the company's fiscal second quarter, according to LSEG.

The pharmaceutical company reported earnings of 10 cents per share, far above expectations of a per-share loss of 13 cents, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Revenue came in at $9.50 billion, more than the $8.95 billion expected.

Hong Kong retail sales clock slowest growth since start of the year
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hong Kong's retail sales grew at their slowest pace since January, highlighting the impact of a global high interest rate environment.

Retail sales for September rose 13% on a year-over-year basis, less than the prior month's 13.7% rise, [official data](https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/web_table.html?id=620-67001) showed late on Wednesday.

"The culprit of sluggish recovery is elevated interest rates, which has been dampening consumption & tourism, external trade, and investment," said Samuel Tse, a DBS economist. "HK economic fundamentals closely follows the Mainland (China)."

Tse says external demand from both China and the rest of the world were tepid, highlighting that rising rates restrained consumption through high fixed deposits rate, a strong [Hong Kong dollar](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HKD=/) and a weak asset market.
