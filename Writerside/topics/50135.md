In a statement Wednesday, the [White House](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house) said the Bidens "will pay respects to the victims of this horrific attack and grieve with families and community members, as well as meet with first responders, nurses, and others on the front lines of the response."

On Oct. 25, a gunman opened fire at the Just-In-Time bowling alley and Schemengees Bar and Grille in Lewiston, Maine. He was found dead two days later from "an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound," according to Maine Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck.
