The Federal Reserve is likely to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged this week at a 22-year high while keeping open the possibility of another rate hike to fight inflation.  
Officials, whose two-day policy meeting concludes Wednesday, could raise rates again in December or next year if the economy doesnâ€™t cool as they expect and inflation picks up again after slowing since June.
