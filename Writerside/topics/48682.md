Quest 3 users are reporting issues with controller tracking performance in VR games that require fast hand movements, with some claiming the older Quest 2 provides a better experience.

Meta is investigating reports of tracking issues blighting its Quest 3 VR headset following user complaints that controller tracking performance is “much worse than the Quest 2” in some games. Over on the [Meta community forums, user NotDream](https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Get-Help/Quest-3-Controller-Tracking-Issues/td-p/1090544) flagged issues with tracking performance on the Quest 3 controllers while playing _Gorilla Tag_ (a VR game that requires users to run, jump, and climb by moving their arms around) claiming that they “lose tracking during medium-fast to fast hand movement” such as throwing or catching a ball.

“This is a big issue for games/activities involving fast-paced hand movement as it’s not nearly as reliable as the Quest 2 controller tracking performance,” said NotDream.

Other forum members in the same thread claim to have encountered similar tracking issues across other VR titles like _Beatsaber_, _Supernatura_l, and _Tennis Esports_. One comment from [a game developer (known as carrotstien) for _Eleven Table Tennis_](https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Get-Help/Quest-3-Controller-Tracking-Issues/m-p/1098806/emcs_t/S2h8ZW1haWx8dG9waWNfc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ufExPQ1hWNjFXNDBQR05OfDEwOTg4MDZ8U1VCU0NSSVBUSU9OU3xoSw#M240556) claims the issues stem from the LED arrangement on the controller. “Oh how I wish the developers of sports games were invited to the table when discussing controller design,” said carrotstien, adding that “there are users which are simply sticking with their quest2 headsets and returning their quest3s because of the tracking issues.”

As [reported by _New World Notes_](https://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2023/10/meta-quest-3-ai-tracking.html), [complaints](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/176mpln/is_anyone_else_having_bad_tracking_on_quest_3/) have [also been](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/176rzri/quest_3_bad_tracking/) [posted to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/16e9zmq/dont_buy_the_quest_3/) in the last few weeks echoing similar tracking problems. The issues seem especially noticeable for competitive gamers who utilize adapters — controller attachments like batting handles that make gameplay feel more natural.

In response to NotDream’s post, Meta Quest Support said that the team is [actively investigating tracking issues](https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Get-Help/Quest-3-Controller-Tracking-Issues/m-p/1096833/highlight/true#M239484) and is working to improve performance, especially for “competitive players” across titles like _Gorilla Tag_, _Supernatural_, _IB Cricket_, and _Eleven Table Tennis_. Some of these improvements are expected to roll out in upcoming releases. We have reached out to Meta for more information on what’s causing the tracking issues and to clarify when a fix will be released.
