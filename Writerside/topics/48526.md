[Yum Brands](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/YUM/) on Wednesday [reported](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231030732696/en/) quarterly revenue that fell short of analysts' expectations, hurt by weak same-store sales growth at Pizza Hut.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in premarket trading.

Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

*   Earnings per share: $1.44 adjusted vs. $1.28 expected
*   Revenue: $1.71 billion vs. $1.77 billion expected

The restaurant company reported third-quarter net income of $416 million, or $1.46 per share, up from $331 million, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, Yum earned $1.44 per share.

Net sales rose 4% to $1.71 billion.
