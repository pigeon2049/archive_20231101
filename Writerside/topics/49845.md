Shares of [Etsy](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ETSY/) fell more than 4% in extended trading Wednesday after the company released [third-quarter results](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/etsy-inc-reports-third-quarter-2023-results-301974725.html) that missed analysts' estimates for revenue, and forecasted a decline in gross merchandise sales, or GMS.

Here's how the company did:

*   **Earnings per share:** 64 cents vs. 51 cents expected by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv
*   **Revenue:** $636 million vs. $641 million expected by LSEG

Revenue rose 7% during the third quarter, up from the $595 million the company reported a year earlier. Etsy reported a net income of $87.9 million, or 64 cents per share, while it reported a net loss of $963.1million during the same period last year.

GMS, which measures the total number of goods sold over a certain period, came in at $3 billion. Etsy said it expects GMS to decline slightly on a year-over-year basis for its fourth quarter.

"There's no doubt that this is an incredibly challenging environment for spending on consumer discretionary items," Etsy CEO Josh Silverman said in a release. It's therefore important to acknowledge that this volatile macro climate will make it challenging for us to grow this quarter.

Services revenue, which includes advertising, grew 16% in Etsy's third quarter. The segment also served as a major sales catalyst during the company's [second quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/03/etsy-shares-plunge-11percent-on-weak-guidance.html), as it grew roughly 21% year over year.

Excluding the after-hours move, shares of Etsy are down more than 49% year to date, while the Nasdaq is down more than 20% for the same period. The stock hit a 52-week low of $59.27 in intra-day trading Wednesday before closing at $60.66.

Etsy will host its quarterly call with investors at 5:00 p.m. ET.
