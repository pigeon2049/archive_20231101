[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) plans to introduce a new paid health service alongside a blood pressure sensor and a system for detecting sleep apnea in the Apple Watch next year, according to a report from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-01/apple-plans-hypertension-sleep-apnea-detection-for-next-watch?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;utm_content=tech&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic#xj4y7vzkg) Wednesday.

The paid health coaching service could provide a new area for Apple to develop recurring subscription revenues. The app will reportedly recommend workouts, presumably through its paid Fitness+ app, and eating plans.

Apple's services business is its second largest, behind the iPhone. It generated [$19.6 billion in revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/03/apple-earnings-live-updates.html) during the third quarter, up 12% year over year. The health coaching service could help the segment continue to grow.

Apple's blood pressure sensor will reportedly detect when a user's blood pressure is elevated, though it won't show their exact measurements. Apple is working on introducing specific diastolic and systolic metrics in a future watch, the report said. There's been [speculation for years](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/02/apple-watch-could-measure-blood-pressure.html) that Apple will eventually add blood pressure sensing to the Apple Watch. Wearables from competitors like Samsung, for example, already offer the option in some markets. Healthcare companies like [Omron](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6645.T-JP/) also already offer [watches that can monitor blood pressure](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/11/amazon-teams-up-with-omron-to-let-alexa-monitor-blood-pressure.html).

Next year's Apple Watch will also reportedly monitor breathing and sleeping habits to predict if a person has sleep apnea, a condition where breathing stops and starts during the night. The watch will reportedly recommend talking to a doctor if it detects potential sleep apnea.

Apple did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
