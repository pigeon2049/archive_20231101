Abstract:

There is a significant global demand for three-letter domain names. Many leading companies across various industries worldwide use three-letter .com domains. For instance: ABC (ABC.com), the National Basketball Association (NBA.com),

Three-letter .com domains have extremely high market value and are favored by investors and end-user enterprises. In recent times, there have been several publicly traded three-letter domains, such as PFA.com, KHY.com, and AiQ.com.

On October 24th, the three-letter domain PFA.com was successfully traded for $450,000 USD (approximately 3 million RMB). Registered in 1995, PFA.com is an excellent three-letter domain. The acquiring party, an end-user enterprise, intends to use the domain for a B2B online marketplace dealing primarily in daily necessities, snacks, and cleaning tools. Currently, the letters "PFA" have been designed into a branded logo.

On October 25th, international celebrity Kylie Jenner acquired the domain KHY.com to develop her new fashion brand. The seller, a Chinese investor, did not disclose the transaction price. The website is prepared and has already uploaded several black clothing designs, with Kylie Jenner as the model. KHY.com, registered in 1996, is an exceedingly scarce and memorable domain. The Chinese seller was unaware of the domain's sale to the well-known international celebrity before the transaction. Industry experts estimate the domain to be worth at least a million dollars.
